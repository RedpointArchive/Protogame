Hardware Sensors
================================

.. note::

    This documentation is a work-in-progress.
    
.. warning::

    The camera sensor APIs are currently only available on Windows Desktop.
    
The sensor module provides access to hardware attached to the machine or device that
your game is running on.  Currently this includes only camera devices, but we expect
this will expand in future to provide abstractions for location and accelerometer
sensors.
