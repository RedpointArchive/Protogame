Physics
====================================================

.. note::

    This documentation is a work-in-progress.

Physics in Protogame is provided by the Jitter_ library, a fully managed
physics engine written in C#.  Therefore, the physics APIs in Protogame
are available on all platforms.

Most of the physics APIs are provided directly by Jitter.
