MonoGame Framework
====================================================

MonoGame is an open source implementation of XNA, a low-level game engine
written in C#.  MonoGame is used in Protogame to provide abstraction of
graphics rendering APIs, audio output and receiving input from hardware
devices.

MonoGame also provides core classes, such as :ref:`Vector3` and :ref:`Matrix`,
which are used for almost all mathematical operations relating to games.

You will encounter these APIs frequently when using Protogame, either
through use of the math APIs, or when you want to perform custom
rendering.
