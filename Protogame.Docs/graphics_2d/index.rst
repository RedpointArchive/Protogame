Graphics: 2D Rendering
====================================================

.. note::

    This documentation is a work-in-progress.

The 2D rendering utilities provide common functionality for rendering
textures, text and other primitives to the screen.

These utilities are available for all games, and are always
bound.  You do not need to load a module to access them.
