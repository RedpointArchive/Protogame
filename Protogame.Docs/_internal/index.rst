Internal Implementations
====================================================

.. warning::

    This documentation covers the internal implementations of services
    offered by Protogame.  While those implementations are always public
    in the Protogame API (to give you the most flexibility), the documentation
    of those classes is not always kept up to date.
    
    You should *always* refer to the service (interface) documentation if
    it is available.

This documentation covers implementation-specific details of how various
services in Protogame are implemented.
