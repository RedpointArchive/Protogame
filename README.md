**NOTE:** Version 4 is still a work-in-progress!

* The latest version (version 4) is available on the `master` branch.
* The last version of version 3 is available at the `v3.0` tag.
* The last version of version 2 is available at the `v2.0` tag.
* The last version of version 1 is available at the `v1.0` tag.

New features in Version 4
-----------------------------

Version 4 breaks compatibility with version 3, in order to introduce the following features:

 * Entities now have matrixes instead of explicit X, Y and Z properties.  This is necessary to
   support hierarchical matrix combination.
 * Worlds no longer have an `Entities` property.  Instead the dependency injection hierarchy is
   used to track entities in the world.  This means entities you inject in the constructor will
   automatically be added to the world.  To add entities to the world, you now need to inject
   `IHierarchy` and `INode` and call `_hierarchy.AddChild(_hierarchy.CreateNodeForObject(entity))`.
   We'll have a cleaner API for entity management in the future that wraps this call.
 * We expect to significantly rework the platforming and bounding box APIs to make them work cleaner
   with the new matrix composition system.
